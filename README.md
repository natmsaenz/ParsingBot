*ParsingBot*
This project was created for Bosch México Audio triage team. With different modules in it, this script will help us to:
-Decompress files into an specific path
-Create new paths so we can decompress files into them
-Convert .dlt files into .txt files so we can handle them more easily
-Compress all the .txt files into one for our convenience
-Detect incidences from an input
All this in a single script and while moving the files to an specific directory.

*Requirements to use the script*
-Having the DLTViewer app installed, the script works with the 2.17.0 stable version. For the script to work, the DLTViewer has to be located on this path: C:\Program Files (x86)\dltviewer\DltViewerSDK\dlt_viewer.exe
*(If you don´t have the DLTviewer app, you can download from this package)* https://inside-docupedia.bosch.com/confluence/display/gen3generic/DLT-viewer
